- This challenges classical theory because **A** and **C** lead to the same outcome and so do **B** and **D**. The example violates the *invariance* assumption of classical theory.
:::

---

### Invariance

:::{.no-bullets .incremental}
- Invariance is not an explicit axiom of decision theory, but it is implied by the framework. 
- We started out by defining utilities over *outcomes.* This implicitly assumes that agents only care about what will happen, but not how they get there. 
    - E.g., if 400 out of 600 people die, it does not matter to the agent whether they *"saved"* 200 or *"killed"* 400; both acts lead to the utility $u(\text{200 alive}).$
- The example challenges the invariance dogma. 
:::

---

### Reference-dependence as a reason for framing effects?

Individuals may prefer the *saving* framing because:

- **Q1** frames the decision relative to a reference point of 600 [dying]{.my-highlight-red}. 

- **Q2** frames the decision relative to a reference point of 600 [surviving]{.my-highlight-blue}.

:::{.fragment}
- In **Q1,** the safe option *gains* 200 lives, while in **Q2,** the safe option kills 400 people.

### More systematic evidence (K&T 1979)

::: {.unnumbered style="text-align: center;"}
![](figures/GainLossRA.png){width=90%}
:::

- When $p$ is high, individuals are risk averse in the gain domain but risk seeking in the loss domain. 
- This consistent with the life saving example. 

---

### Making sense 

::: {.incremental .no-bullets}
- K&T propose to replace the **utility function** $u$ over outcomes with a **value function** $v$ over gains and losses. 

- The value function compares outcome $z$ to **reference point** $r.$ 
    - If $z \geq r,$ gain domain. 
    - If $z < r,$ loss domain. 

- Additional assumptions: 
$\small v'(z - r) > 0,\,v''(z-r) < 0\text{ if }z\geq r,\, v''(z-r) > 0\text{ if }z < r$

:::

---

### Illustration 

:::{.incremental .no-bullets}
- In Problem 9, K&T find the modal choices:
$$
\begin{aligned}
&(4000,.25;2000,.25;0,.5) \quad &\succ& \quad (6000,.25;0,.75), \\ 
&(-6000,.25;0,.75) \quad &\succ& \quad (-4000,.25;-2000,.25;0,.5)
\end{aligned}
$$

- Gains: $\small\pi(.25)[v(4k) + v(2k)] > \pi(.25)v(6k) \Rightarrow  v(4k) + v(2k) > v(6k)$
    - $v$ needs to be concave in gains to accomodate this. 
- Losses: $\small\pi(.25)[v(-4k) + v(-2k)] < \pi(.25)v(-6k)$ 
- $\Rightarrow  v(-4k) + v(-2k) < v(-6k)$
    - $v$ needs to be convex in losses to accomodate this.

Thaler (JEBO, 1980) tells the following story.

:::{.example}
**Story.**
Mr R bought wine at \$5/bottle in 1958. A merchant later offers **\$100** per bottle; he refuses, though he never pays more than \$35 for a bottle.
:::

:::{.incremental .no-bullets}
- This example is hard to rationalize with EU:
    - Not selling at wealth $y$ for \$100 implies $\small u(\text{1 wine}, \$y) > u(\text{0 wine}, \$100 + \$y).$
    - Not buying for \$35 implies $\small u(\text{1 wine}, \$y - \$35) < u(\text{0 wine}, \$y).$

### Endowment effect

:::{.no-bullets}
- LA can explain why people often feel reluctant to buy *and* to sell.
    - This is known as the **endowment effect.**
- According to LA, the endowment effect occurs because:
    - When people sell something, they encode it as a loss.
    - When people buy something, they encode it as a gain. 
    - The joy of gain is smaller than the pain of equivalent loss.
- Consequently the **willingness to pay (WTP)** is smaller than the **willingness to accept (WTA)**
:::

---

### Endowment effect beyond Mr R

:::{.no-bullets .incremental}
- Kahneman, Knetsch, Thaler (JPE, 1990) conduct an experimental test of the endowment effect. 
- Participants randomly receive a [mug]{style="color: var(--my-blue);"} or [nothing]{style="color: var(--my-red);"}.
- They are asked for their WTA ([mug owners]{style="color: var(--my-blue);"}) or WTP ([unlucky ones]{style="color: var(--my-red);"}) for the mug.
    - Elicitation incentivized using the `BDM Mechanism.`

- The median [WTA]{style="color: var(--my-blue);"} was **\$7** while the median [WTP]{style="color: var(--my-red);"} was **\$3.**
    - Clean evidence of the endowment effect.
:::

---

### Endowment effect in labor supply

:::{.no-bullets .incremental}
- Camerer, Babckock, Loewenstein, Thaler (QJE, 1997) study cab drivers in NYC. 
- These drivers face highly volatile wages. CBLT ask: How does this affect their labor supply?
:::

---

### Cab driver labor supply

:::{.no-bullets .incremental}
- Consider a standard labor supply model. A worker enjoys consumption $c$ and leisure $\ell,$ given time budget $T.$ They choose labor hours $h$ with hwage $w,$ allowing consumption $c=wh.$ 
- Assuming quasilinear preferences ($\ell' > 0,\,\ell'' <0$):
$$
\small\underset{h}{\text{max}}\quad u(h) = wh + \ell(T - h).
$$
- This has first-order condition $w = \ell'(T-h).$
- Standard result:
$\small \frac{d h}{d w} = -\frac{1}{\ell''(T-h)}>0$ (hours increase in wages).

:::

---

## {auto-animate="true"}
### Adding loss aversion

:::{.no-bullets}
- Suppose now that cab drivers are loss averse. 
$$
u_\lambda(h) = \underbrace{wh + \ell(T-h)}_{\text{Standard}} + \underbrace{g(wh - r).}_{\text{Gain-loss } u}
$$
- **Idea:** Cab drivers have a daily *reference income* $r.$ If they earn less, they experience a loss. If they earn more, they experience a gain.
:::

---

## {auto-animate="true"}
### Adding loss aversion

:::{.no-bullets}
- Suppose now that cab drivers are loss averse. 
$$
u_\lambda(h) = \underbrace{wh + \ell(T-h)}_{\text{Standard}} + \underbrace{g(wh - r).}_{\text{Gain-loss } u}
$$
- Gain-loss utility is a function:
$$
g(wh - r) = \begin{cases}
\eta(wh-r),\, wh\geq r, \\
\lambda\eta(wh-r),\, wh < r.
\end{cases}
$$
- Above, $\lambda > 1$ is the **loss aversion parameter** and $\eta>0$ is a utility weight.

- The right panel plots the solution w/ loss aversion. 
:::

---

## {auto-animate="true"}
### Consequences

![](figures/LaborSupply.png){width=95%}

:::{.no-bullets}
- The marginal benefit of working more jumps at $\hat{h} =\frac{r}{w}.$ 
- This is where working more turns losses into gains.
- Consequently, the optimal solution may be to work exactly $\hat{h}$ hours. If so, hours *decrease* in $w.$
:::

---

### CBLT: Cab drivers work less as wages increase

![](figures/CabDriversLS.png){width=95%}

High wage → reach daily‑income *target* sooner → quit 

---

### Taking stock

- Loss aversion has been crystalized as the most important reference-dependent preference in economic applications. 
- It is regularly invoked to explain *inertia* and *targeting behavior*:
    - The endowment effect as an explanaition of why individuals hang on to what they have. 
    - Income targeting in labor supply. 
    - Many more examples from sports, where runners may target running times, golfers target handicaps, etc. 

---

### However,

:::{.no-bullets .incremental}
- With LA, we have to take a number of **difficult conceptual decisions.**
    - [What is]{style="color: var(--my-red);"} a reference point? 
        - E.g., do cab drivers target *income* or *working hours*.
    - [Who experiences]{style="color: var(--my-blue);"} losses and why? 
        - I may be reluctant to sell my dinner table, but [IKEA]{style="color: var(--my-yellow);"} probably is not.
- Follow-up research tried finding **more parsimonious** ways of capturing gains and losses. We will learn about them next.

## Expectations‑Based Loss Aversion (EBLA)
*(Kőszegi & Rabin QJE 2006)*

:::{.incremental .no-bullets}
- K&R propose a theory of **endogenous** reference points that are governed by **rational expectations**.
- This should sound familiar to you. 
- [**LA problem:**]{style="color: var(--my-red);"} We have a free model parameter $r$.
- [**K&R solution:**]{style="color: var(--my-blue);"} Say $r$ is an expectation → assume expectations are rational → $r$ is no longer a *free parameter,* but part of the model solution. 


:::

---

## {auto-animate="true"}
### EBLA Model Setup

:::{.incremental .no-bullets}
- Consider an agent with utility consisting of a *material* and a *reference-dependent* part:
$$
\small u_{KR}(c|r) = m(c) + n(c|r).
$$
- $c = (c_1,\ldots,c_K)$ is a $K$-dimensional **consumption vector** and $r = (r_1,\ldots,r_K)$ is a $K$-dimensional **reference vector.** 
- Utility is seperable accross dimensions:
$$
\small m(c) = \sum_{k=1}^K m_k(c_k),\, n(c|r) = \sum_{k=1}^K n_k(c_k|r_k).
$$
:::

---

## {auto-animate="true"}

:::{.no-bullets}
- Utility is seperable accross dimensions:
$$
\small m(c) = \sum_{k=1}^K m_k(c_k),\, n(c|r) = \sum_{k=1}^K n_k(c_k|r_k).
$$
- Gain-loss utility is piecewise linear:
$$
\small
n_k(c_k|r_k) = \begin{cases}
\eta (m_k(c_k) - m_k(r_k)), m_k(c_k) \geq m_k(r_k) \\
\lambda\eta (m_k(c_k) - m_k(r_k)), m_k(c_k) < m_k(r_k).
\end{cases}
$$
- Here, $\lambda > 1$ measures loss aversion and $\eta>0$ is a utility weight.
:::

---

### The reference point 

:::{.no-bullets .incremental}
- K&R allow for consumption to be stochastic and be distributed according to a function $f(c)\in\Delta\mathbb{R}^K.$
    - E.g., the agent may choose a lottery. 
- Crucially, the reference point is *also* stochastic and distributed according to $g(r)\in\Delta\mathbb{R}^K.$
    - E.g., when choosing a lottery paying either $100$ or $0,$ the agent may not have a clear reference point. This formulation allows for this. 
:::
---

### The reference point 

:::{.no-bullets .incremental}
- Expected utility from holding reference point $g(r):$
$$
\small U_{KR}(c|g) = \int_{r\in\mathbb{R}^K}u(c|r)g(r)dr.
$$
- Expected utility from expecting consumption $f(c):$
$$
\small U_{KR}(f|g) = \int_{c\in\mathbb{R}^K}\left(\int_{r\in\mathbb{R}^K}u(c|r)g(r)dr\right) f(c) dc.
$$
:::

---

### Example {.example}

:::{.no-bullets .incremental}
- Suppose that there is only one dimension ($K=1$). 
- Suppose that the reference point is a lottery $g = (100,p;0,1-p)$ and the agent evaluates a sure payment of $50$ ($f = (50,1)$). 
- The agent evaluates this sure payment as a mixture of a gain and loss:
$$
U_{KR}(f|g) = p\cdot u(50|100) + (1-p)\cdot u(50|0).
$$
:::

---

### Example' {.example}

:::{.no-bullets .incremental}
- Keep the reference point the same but now suppose that the agent's consumption lottery is $f' = (200, q; -200, 1-q).$ 
- Then:
$$
\begin{align*}
\small U_{KR}(f'|g) &= p[q u(200|100) + (1-q)u(-200|100)] \\ 
\small &+ (1-p)[q u(200|0) + (1-q) u(-200|0)].
\end{align*}
$$
:::

---

## {auto-animate="true"}
### Why this may help 

:::{.no-bullets .incremental}
- The stochastic reference point allows us to make the reference point endogenous to choices. 
- Suppose the agent chooses lottery $L=(100,p;0,1-p)$. They may plausibly perceive winning $100$ more like a gain and winning $0$ more like a loss. 
- We can now formalize this by assuming that $r=L:$
$$
\begin{align*}
\small U_{KR}(L|L) = p[p u(100|100) + (1-p)u(0|100)] + \\
\small (1-p)[p u(100|0) + (1-p) u(0|0)].
\end{align*}
$$

:::

---

### Personal equilibrium 

K&R formalize the idea that reference points are *endogenous* to choices.

:::{.definition}
**Definition.** A selection $L\in \mathcal{C}$ is a personal equilibrium if for all $L'\in \mathcal{C}$ $U_{KR}(L|L)\geq U_{KR}(L'|L).$ 
:::

:::{.fragment}
Note that an equilibrium is a **solution concept.** We can use it to simultaneously solve for the agent's consumption and reference point. 
:::

## {auto-animate="true"}
### Buying shoes {.example}

:::{.no-bullets .incremental}
- Suppose our agent goes shopping for shoes. Set $K=2,$ with $c_1\in\{0,1\}$ denoting whether they bought shoes and $c_2\in\mathbb{R}$ denoting money. We assume that everything is linear:
$$
u_{KR}(c|r) = c_1 + c_2 + \mu(c_1|r_1) + \mu(c_2|r_2). 
$$
- Buying shoes costs $p.$ There are two possible outcomes. Either A buys so that $c = (c_1 = 1, c_2 = -p)$ or A doesn't buy; $c = (c_1 = 0, c_2 = 0).$

## AFGH (2011) Design

::: {.no-bullets .incremental}

- **EBLA prediction:** Participants in [HI]{style="color:var(--my-blue)"} expect more than those in [LO]{style="color:var(--my-red)"}. Thus, they experience potentially higher losses. They should work harder.

- Same task, but participants either receive a high payment $H$ with probability $p$, a low payment $L$ with probability $q$, or are paid a piece rate for their effort with $1-p-q.$

### Later developments

- A possible explanation for the mixed support may be that not everyone is universally loss averse; some may even be loss seeking. Then, we might not always see homogenous effects. 
- One experiment by Campos-Mercade, Goette, Graeber, Kellog, Sprenger (WP, 2023) looks into this. 
- They have a framework in which the loss aversion parameter $\lambda$ can be $>1$ (loss averse) or $<1$ (loss seeking). 
- They empirically investigate labor supply in a **stated effort** task.

### Stated effort  

::: {.no-bullets .incremental}
- With stated effort, participants ex-ante declare how much they will work.
    - E.g., they are given a wage schedule, decide that they will solve $X$ tasks and then have to stay until they have solved $X$. 
    - This is useful because it allows the experimenter to identify labor supply functions *within individuals:*
        - A participant may declare they will work $X'$ if wage is $w'$ and $X''$ if wage is $w''.$ Then, one wage schedule is randomly drawn and the respective decision is implemented.

### CGGKS: Design  

::: {.no-bullets .incremental}
1. There is a task to elicit $\lambda$ on the individual level. (We will skip this now, but see the exercise sheet.)
2. Stated effort task under two conditions:
    - **LOW:** Receive \$0 with [45%]{style="color:var(--my-red)"}, receive \$20 with [5%]{style="color:var(--my-blue)"}, be paid for effort performance with 50%
    - **HIGH:** Receive \$0 with [5%]{style="color:var(--my-blue)"}, receive \$20 with [45%]{style="color:var(--my-red)"}, be paid for effort performance with 50%
    - Same idea as earlier: If loss averse, work more in HIGH than in LOW.

- Average TE increases in $\lambda$ (left panel).
- Going from LOW to HIGH, more positive TEs among those with higher $\lambda$ (right panel).

### Wrapping up 

1. **Reference-Dependent Preferences**:
    - Frames influence perception of outcomes as gains or losses.
    - Violates classical invariance assumption in decision theory.

2. **Prospect Theory (PT)**:
    - Combines probability weighting and a loss-averse value function.
    - Predicts fourfold risk attitudes: risk-seeking for low-probability gains and high-probability losses; risk-averse otherwise.

---

3. **Applications of Loss Aversion**:
    - **Endowment Effect**: Reluctance to trade due to loss aversion.
    - **Labor Supply**: Income targeting.

4. **Expectations-Based Loss Aversion (EBLA)**:
    - Reference points are endogenous and based on rational expectations.
    - Clarifies how expectations are endogenous to decisions. This can lead to **multiple equilibria** because of decisions and expectations are **complements.**

---

5. **Empirical Evidence**:
    - Mixed support for EBLA in experiments (e.g., Abeler et al. 2011, Gneezy et al. 2017).
    - Heterogeneous loss aversion (Campos-Mercade et al. 2023) shows stronger effects for highly loss-averse individuals.

6. **Key Takeaways**:
    - Frames and reference points drive decisions.
    - LA explains important behavioral regularities (endowment effect, income targeting).
    - EBLA adds discipline.
