### Why talk about **stereotypes**?

::: {.incremental .no-bullets}
- *Less* information sometimes *improves* decisions  
  - E.g., the introduction of blind orchestral auditions increased female hires (Goldin & Rouse, AER 2000).  
- This implies **pre-existing stereotypes** can distort decisions.
- How do such stereotypes form and persist?  
  <br/>This lecture: robust empirical patterns and a new memory-based model.

Which is **more probable**?  
1. Linda is a bank-teller  
2. Linda is a bank-teller **and** a feminist  
:::

Picking (2) violates **sum rule**:  

- The event "bank-teller + feminist" is a subset of the event "bank-teller". By the sum rule, $P(\text{bank-teller + feminist})\le P(\text{bank-teller}).$  

---

::: {.incremental .no-bullets}
- The Linda example is interesting because it intuitively cues associations in our brain:
    - *"Linda cares about social justice and is against nuclear power, so she **must be** a feminist."*
- The same kind of thinking seems to occur in other contexts.
    - For example, people may reason: *"He supports right-wing populism so he **must be** a misogynist, bigot, and have a worryingly high consumption of energy drinks."*
- How do these associations occur? To understand this, we need to learn a bit about human memory...

### Modeling memory 

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
:::{.no-bullets}
- Suppose we aim to have a psychologically realistic model of how people remember. The first thing that we might want to assume is that people forget things. 
- This is the **sieve model** of memory. Individuals learn and store information, but over time, some details slip through and are lost.

### Memory as a sieve? 

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
:::{.no-bullets}
- The sieve model explains *some* memory features but misses out big parts. We do not only forget randomly, but also **suppress, reconstruct, and modify.**
- This research started with Bartlett (1930), who documents systematic distortions over time.

- A better analogy may be **memory as [Google search:]{style="color:var(--my-blue)"}**
    1. Google is imperfect, you do not always find what you search for. 
    2. But what you find can change day-by-day, just as you might sometimes remember what you thought you had forgotten. 
    3. Google does not always provide you with exactly what you are looking for.
        - E.g., googling *"weather in munich"* might return ad results on summer clothes. 
        - Just as when thinking about *summer,* you may make associations to *ice cream*.

- A better analogy may be **memory as [Google search.]{style="color:var(--my-blue)"}**
- Psychologists broadly think about memory along these lines. They call it **associative memory.**
- We will link associative memory to the existence and persistence of stereotypes.

### Associative memory and stereotypes? 

::: {.incremental .no-bullets}
- **Question:** What is the % of red hair among the Irish? 
- The basic argument for why associative memory makes us overestimate this %:
    1. When I think about (red hair, Irish), a lot of reasons come to mind providing good evidence that many Irish persons are red haired. 
    2. When I think about (other hair, Irish), it is easy for my memory to make associations with *other-haired* people that are *not* Irish.

2. When I think about (other hair, Irish), it is easy for my memory to make associations with *other-haired* people that are *not* Irish.
    - Many non-Irish other-haired people exist. 
    - Relatively fewer non-Irish red-haired people exist. 
    - Therefore, *memory interference* is larger when I think about (other hair, Irish) than about (red hair, Irish) $\rightarrow$ This makes me overestimate the %.
:::

---

### A minimal formal set-up  
*Bordalo, Conlon, Gennaioli, Kwon, Shleifer (QJE, 2022)*

::: {.no-bullets}
- Consider an agent with a **memory database** $E$ which contains entries with *attribute vector* $a=(a_1,a_2).$ 
    - For example: $a_1 =$ hair color (red/other), $a_2 =$ nationality (Irish/non-Irish). 
- The agent's **task** is to estimate a conditional share $P(a_1|a_2).$
    - For example $P(a_1 = \text{red hair}| a_2 = \text{Irish}).$
:::

---

### The memory database 

::: {.no-bullets}
- Think of the memory database as capturing the joint distribution of $(a_1,a_2).$ For example, the database may be:  
:::

| | **Red Hair** | **Other hair** |
|-| ------------ | -------------- |
| **Irish** | 1% | 9% |
| **Non-Irish** | 1% | 89% |

- Searching for $(\text{Red Hair, Irish})$ returns $\small E(\text{Red Hair, Irish}) = 1\%.$
- An unbiased of $P(\text{Red Hair | Irish})$ is $\small \frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.09} = 10\%.$ 

---

### Assumption 1 --- Sampling and Counting

:::{.definition}
**Sampling and counting**. To form belief $P(a_1 = x|a_2 = y),$ an agent sends two requests to their memory database, $q_1,$ asking for $T$ samples as evidence of $(a_1 = x\text{ and }a_2 = y)$ and $q_2,$ asking for $T>0$ samples as evidence of $(a_1 \neq x\text{ and }a_2 = y).$ The agent then keeps all the results that cohere with each request. Denote the observed coherent results by $R_{q_1}$ and $R_{q_2}$, respectively. In a second step, the agent combines these requests to obtain the estimate:
$$
\small\hat{P}(a_1 = x|a_2 = y) = \frac{R_{q_1}}{R_{q_1} + R_{q_2}}.
$$
:::
---

### Sampling & Counting Example

::: {.no-bullets}
- Recall the memory database, which captures the joint distribution:

| | **Red Hair** | **Other hair** |
|-| ------------ | -------------- |
| **Irish** | 1% | 9% |
| **Non-Irish** | 1% | 89% |

- Suppose the agent samples with $T = 100.$
- The agent first draws 100 samples from their database and keeps all results with (Red Hair, Irish) ... 
- The agent then draws 100 samples from their database and keeps all results with (Other Hair, Irish) ... 
- If this sampling is unbiased, then $R_{q_1} \approx 0.1\%\cdot T = 10$ and $R_{q_2} \approx 0.9\% \cdot T = 90$. 
- The estimate based on unbiased sampling is approx. equal to the truth:
$P(\text{red hair, Irish}) \approx \frac{10}{10 + 90} = 10\%$
:::

---

::: {.no-bullets .incremental}
- If this sampling is unbiased, then $\small R_{q_1} \approx 1\%\cdot T = 1$ and $\small R_{q_2} \approx 9\% \cdot T = 9.$
- The estimate based on unbiased sampling is approx. equal to the truth:
$\small P(\text{red hair} | \text{Irish}) \approx \frac{1}{1 + 9} = 10\%.$
- This sampling approach to belief formation is very common in cognitive psychology. 
    - It approximates the recall process, where people sort through examples in their memory. 
    - You can also think of this as **simulation.** Rather than sorting through past memories of meeting Irish people, people may simulate examples of how Irish people may be like. 
:::

---

### Assumption 2 --- Cued recall  

::: definition
**Cued recall.** When cued with a query $q$, the probability of recalling an entry with attributes $\mathbf{a}$ is equal to 

$$
r_q(\mathbf{a})=\frac{S(\mathbf{a},q)\;E(\mathbf{a})}{\sum_{\mathbf{a}'\in\mathcal A}S(\mathbf{a}',q)\,E(\mathbf{a}')}.
$$

Above, $S$ is a *similarity function* and $\mathcal{A}$ is the set of all possible attribute combinations.
:::

Under cued recall, the agent is more likely to recall items similar to their query.

---

## {auto-animate="true"}
### Cued recall: Example

::: {.no-bullets}
- Suppose that the similarity function is: 

$$
\small
S(\mathbf{a},q) = \begin{cases}
1 &, q_1 = a_1 \text{and }q_2 = a_2 \\ 
\small 1/2 &, q_1 = a_1 \text{and }q_2 \neq a_2 \text{ or }q_1\neq a_1 \text{and }q_2=a_2  \\ 
\small 0 &, q_1 \neq a_1 \text{and }q_2 \neq a_2 \\ 
\end{cases}
$$

::: {.fragment}

- Then, in our leading example, after searching for $\small q_1 = (\text{red hair, irish}):$
$$
\small r_{q_1}(\text{red, irish}) = \frac{1\cdot 0.01}{1\cdot 0.01 + 1/2 \cdot 0.09 + 1/2\cdot 0.01 + 0\cdot 0.9} \approx 0.167
$$

### Cued recall: Example

::: {.no-bullets}
- Then, in our leading example, after searching for $q_1 = (\text{red hair, irish}):$

$$
\small r_{q_1}(\text{red, irish}) = \frac{1\cdot 0.01}{1\cdot 0.01 + 1/2 \cdot 0.09 + 1/2\cdot 0.01 + 0\cdot 0.89} \approx 0.167
$$

- After searching for $q_2 = (\text{other hair, irish}):$

$$
\small r_{q_2}(\text{other, irish}) = \frac{1\cdot 0.09}{1\cdot 0.09 + 1/2 \cdot 0.01 + 1/2\cdot 0.89 + 0\cdot 0.01} \approx 0.167
$$

:::
---

## {auto-animate="true"}
### Combining both assumptions

::: {.no-bullets .incremental}
- Recall that, under sampling and counting, the agent samples $T$ times for search terms $q_1$ and $q_2$ and forms the estimate
$\small\hat{P}(\text{red hair} | \text{irish}) = \frac{R_{q_1}}{R_{q_1} + R_{q_2}}.$
- By the law of large numbers, if $T$ is large, the agent's belief is approx. equal to $\small\hat{P}(\text{red hair} | \text{irish}) \approx \frac{r_{q_1}(\text{red hair, irish})}{r_{q_1}(\text{red hair, irish}) + r_{q_2}(\text{other hair, irish})}.$
- In our example, we have $\small\hat{P}(\text{red hair} | \text{irish}) \approx \frac{0.167}{0.167 + 0.167} = 50\%.$
  - The agent widely overestimates $P(\text{red hair} | \text{irish})!$
:::

---

## {auto-animate="true"}
### Model Mechanism

::: {.no-bullets .incremental}
- When searching $(\text{red hair, irish})$, the agent either finds what they are looking for, or there is *interference* by (i) other hair Irish, (ii) red hair non-Irish.
- When searching $(\text{other hair, irish})$, the agent either finds what they are looking for, or there is *interference* by (i) red hair Irish, (ii) other hair non-Irish.
:::
---

- When searching $(\text{other hair, irish})$, the agent either finds what they are looking for, or there is *interference* by (i) [red hair Irish]{style="color:var(--my-blue)"}, (ii) other hair non-Irish.
  1. In both searches, the terms interfere with [one another.]{style="color:var(--my-blue)"}

  2. The searches are also interfered by the [other group's members.]{style="color:var(--my-red)"}

::: {.no-bullets}
- When searching $(\text{red hair, irish})$, the agent either finds what they are looking for, or there is *interference* by (i) [other hair Irish]{style="color:var(--my-blue)"}, (ii) [red hair non-Irish.]{style="color:var(--my-red)"}

→ Because there are many more other hair non-Irish than red hair non-Irish, the search interference is much higher for $q_2$ than for $q_1.$ This leads the agent to overestimate.
:::

---

### Model Summary

::: {.no-bullets}
- In the model, memory is probabilistic. 
  - The agent cannot access the whole memory database at once. 
- Searching the memory database is imperfect.
  - The agent does not only end up with evidence for which they searched for.
  - However, *cued recall* skews the search towards memories more similar to the search term.
:::

---

### Model Results

::: {.no-bullets}
- The model predicts that individuals overestimate features that are **diagnostic** of a certain group 
  - This is because there's less interference when recalling **diagnostic** features.
  - E.g., red hair is relatively overrepresented (i.e., diagnostic) among the Irish.
  - Other examples: Old people among Floridians, beer drinkers among Bavarians, rational calculators among economists.

→ Cued recall *amplifies* pre-existing differences.
:::

---

### Model Extensions

::: {.no-bullets}
- The model can be extended among several domains to make it more realistic. Two important domains are:
  - **Imperfect memory and learning:** The agent may forget parts of their memory database or consciously add entries to it. 
  - **Skewed memory databases:** The memory database entries may be biased through: Cultural norms, media bias, subjective experiences, etc.
- Even under such extension the main result still applies: Cued recall will *amplify* any pre-existing group differences present in the memory database.

# Laboratory evidence for cued recall  

---

### Design – Bordalo et al. (2022)

People see words or numbers that are either colored orange or blue:

<div style="font-size:1.5em; line-height:2;">
  <span style="color:orange;">apple</span> &nbsp;
  <span style="color:blue;">table</span> &nbsp;
  <span style="color:orange;">17</span> &nbsp;
  <span style="color:blue;">car</span> &nbsp;
  <span style="color:orange;">music</span> &nbsp;
  <span style="color:blue;">42</span> &nbsp;
  <span style="color:orange;">river</span> &nbsp;
  <span style="color:blue;">dog</span> &nbsp;
  <span style="color:orange;">book</span> &nbsp;
  <span style="color:blue;">99</span>
</div>

40 such items → filler task → ask for $\small P(\text{word}\mid\text{orange})\;?$

---

### Treatments

Across treatments, they increase (i) the share of words among blue, (ii) the share of words among orange.

![](figures/MemoryExperiment.png){width=68% .center}

- Increasing blue words tests for **interference.** 
- Increasing orange words tests whether recall is tied to the true underlying frequencies.

---

### Results  

![](figures/MemoryExperimentResults.png){width=68% .center}

::: {.no-bullets .incremental}
1. More blue-word clutter reduces the recalled orange-word share.  
2. Raising true orange-word share raises estimates, but **less than 1-for-1**.  
✔️ Matches model predictions.

# Field evidence --- Media narratives

---

### Memory associations induced by the media
*Keita, Renault, and Valette (EJ, 2023)*

::: {.no-bullets .incremental}
- **Testable model prediction:** What kind of features people ascribe to groups depends on what they learned in the past.
- When cued with a feature, individuals will draw on their memory to "fill in" the group that is likely to have this feature.
  - The media potentially influences these associations by how they report about events.

:::
---

### KRV: Setting

![](figures/SZDisclosure.png){width=100%}

KRV use an editorial change at the *Sächsische Zeitung* as a natural experiment. In 2016, the newspaper consistently began to disclose an offender's nationality whenever reporting on a crime.

## {auto-animate="true"}
### KRV: Findings

Regression outcome variable: "How important is topic X to you?"

Main dependent variable: SZ market share w/ post editorial change interaction
 
---

## {auto-animate="true"}
### KRV: Findings

![](figures/SZEffects.png){width=100%}

→ Readers **downgraded** immigration worries, **upgraded** crime worries.  

This suggests that the consistent disclosure of offender nationality introduced *counter-stereotypical* memory associations. 

---

---

## Takeaways

::: {.no-bullets}
- Stereotypes and belief distortions can arise from how memory works, not just from biased data.
- Memory is **associative;** it amplifies diagnostic features of groups, leading to stereotypical beliefs.
- Laboratory and field evidence support the model: memory interference and media cues shape beliefs.
- Understanding memory-based belief formation helps explain persistent stereotypes.
