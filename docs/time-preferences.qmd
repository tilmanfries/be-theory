### Choice over time

::: {.incremental .no-bullets}
- The costs and benefits of decisions often occur at different point in time.
- *Studying*, *exercising*, *investing* today bring future rewards, but present costs. 
- *Borrowing*, *sin foods*, *recreational drugs* bring present rewards but future costs.
:::

### The distribution of costs and benefits over time is often highly predictable...

### ...but that doesn't lead to easily navigable decisions

:::

In Allcott et al. (AER, 2022) most students say they *exercise too little, waste time online, eat junk, save too little, etc.*

## Formalizing choice over time 

:::{.no-bullets}
- Consider an agent with preferences over outcomes $\mathbf z.$
- We have discrete time periods $t=0,\dots,T.$
- In every $t,$ the agent receives **instantaneous utility** $u_t = u(z_t).$ 
    - This results in an overall **utility stream** $\mathbf u=(u_0,\dots,u_T).$
- Preferences at time $t$: $\succ_t$
:::

---

## {auto-animate="true"}
### Time discounting

:::{.no-bullets}
- We assume that utility is *time-separable*. This implies that we can write utility from the vantage point of $t$ as 
$$
\small
U_t(u) = \sum_{k=0}^{T-t}D(k)u_{t+k} = D(0) + D(1)u_{t+1}+\dots + D(T-t)u_T.
$$
:::

- Above, $D(k)$ is a **discount factor.**

### Time discounting

:::{.no-bullets}
$$
\small
U_t(u) = \sum_{k=0}^{T-t}D(k)u_{t+k} = D(0) + D(1)u_{t+1}+\dots + D(T-t)u_T.
$$
:::

- Above, $D(k)$ is a **discount factor.**

:::{.axiom}
**Assumption.** The discount factor is **exponential** if $D(k) = \delta^k,$ where $\delta\in(0,1]$. If $\delta < 1,$ this means that the agent weights the future less strongly than the present.

- Standard economic models use exponential discounting. An arbitrary choice? 

> *"It is completely arbitrary to assume that the individual behaves as to maximize an integral envisaged in [the exponential discounting model]"* — Paul Samuelson (1937), in the article introducing the concept.

## {auto-animate="true"}
### A better (?) reason for exponential discounting
::: {.no-bullets }
- Suppose we believe that human behavior is time-consistent. By this, we mean that individuals carry through with their plans. 
:::

::: {.definition}
For all $t$ and $\tau\!>\!t$ an agent is **time-consistent** if  
$\boldsymbol{z} \succ_t \boldsymbol{z}' \iff \boldsymbol{z} \succ_\tau \boldsymbol{z}'$  
whenever $\boldsymbol{z}_t=\boldsymbol{z}_t'$ for $t<\tau$.
:::

---

## {auto-animate="true"}
### Time-consistency: Example 

::: {.definition}
For all $t$ and $\tau\!>\!t$ an agent is **time-consistent** if  
$\boldsymbol{z} \succ_t \boldsymbol{z}' \iff \boldsymbol{z} \succ_\tau \boldsymbol{z}'$  
whenever $\boldsymbol{z}_t=\boldsymbol{z}_t'$ for $t<\tau$.
:::

::: {.no-bullets}
- Consider the outcome vectors $\boldsymbol{z} = (\text{relax, gym})$ and $\boldsymbol{z}' = (\text{relax, relax}).$ 
- Time consistency says that if 
    - today, I prefer going to the gym tomorrow ($\boldsymbol{z} \succ_0 \boldsymbol{z}'$),
    - then, tomorrow, I will still prefer going to the gym ($\boldsymbol{z} \succ_1 \boldsymbol{z}'$)
:::

---

### Exponential Discounting implies time consistency (and vice versa)


::: proposition
**Proposition.**
An agent with utility function $U_t(u) = \sum_{k=0}^{T-t}D(k)u_{t+k}$ is time-consistent if and only if the discount function is exponential.
:::

(proof on board)

::: {.incremental .no-bullets}
- Therefore, if time consistency is important to us, we should assume exponential discounting. 
- Conversely, if we do not believe that humans are time-consistent, we should not assume exponential discounting.

# Testing for time consistency?

### Early evidence – Thaler (EL, 1980) 

Thaler asks participants the following question:

> How much would you require in `[one month / one year / ten years]` to make you indifferent to receiving $15 now?

|  | 1 mo | 1 yr | 10 yrs |
|--|------|-----:|-------:|
| Median answer | $20 | $50 | $100 | 
| Implied monthly $\delta$ | .75 | .90 | .98 |


::: fragment
- $\delta$ depends on the time horizon → violates ED.  
- People demand a big premium to delay by *one* month, smaller extra premium for later delays.
:::

---

### The β-δ model (Present Bias)

$$
U_{t}^{\beta,\delta}(\mathbf u)=u_t+\beta\sum_{k=1}^{T-t}\delta^{\,k}u_{t+k},
\qquad 0<\beta\le1.
$$

- $\delta$ : standard exponential discount factor
- $\beta<1$ : **present bias** – all future periods are devalued by a common factor

With $\beta=0.8$ Thaler’s answers give roughly **constant** $\delta\!\approx\!.94$.

---

### Problems with Thaler (EL, 1980)

:::{.no-bullets}
- Thaler's experiment did not use real incentives. Thus, the answers may not have been chosen carefully. 
- For example, the implied discount rate is high.
    - At such high $\delta,$ study participants should borrow generously by taking on consumer credit, more than people usually do. 
- But incentivizing may be difficult.
    - Logistics of paying someone in 10 years. 
    - Hassle costs for participants if they have to return to the lab for cash payments...

### Stationarity vs. Present Bias

Modern tests of time discounting often test for stationarity. Denote an option generating outcome $z$ in $t$ as $(z,t)$. Then:

::: definition
**Stationarity**: $\succ$ depends only on *delay difference*, not on calendar date  
$$
\small
(z,t{+}\Delta_1)\sim_t(z',t{+}\Delta_2)
\;\;\Longrightarrow\;\;
(z,t'{+}\Delta_1)\sim_{t'}(z',t'{+}\Delta_2),
$$
for $\Delta_1, \Delta_2 > 0.$
:::

- ED ⇒ stationarity.

### Stationarity vs. Present Bias

::: definition
**Stationarity**: $\succ$ depends only on *delay difference*, not on calendar date  
$$
\small
(z,t{+}\Delta_1)\sim_t(z',t{+}\Delta_2)
\;\;\Longrightarrow\;\;
(z,t'{+}\Delta_1)\sim_{t'}(z',t'{+}\Delta_2),
$$
for $\Delta_1, \Delta_2 > 0.$
:::

- **Present bias** breaks stationarity: “X€ now vs. Y€ in a week” ≠ “X€ tomorrow vs. Y€ in eight days”.

### Andreoni and Sprenger (AER, 2012): Convex Time-Budget (CTB) experiment

::: {.no-bullets .incremental}
- A&S provide a comprehensive empirical description of choice over time.
- Participants have to allocate a budget of 100 tokens between two dates (e.g., today or in 10 weeks).
    - These tokens will be converted to dollars and paid out (incentives). 
    - The exchange rates may differ between two dates → trace demand curves.

### Andreoni and Sprenger (AER, 2012): Convex Time-Budget (CTB) experiment

::: {.no-bullets .incremental}
- They include a host of measures to convince participants that:
    - They will be paid at the specified date. 
    - There are no hassle costs involved with delayed payments.
        - Payments are delivered by a mailed check, even today's.
:::

---

### A&S: Decision screen

![](figures/CTBDecisionScreen.png){width=70%}

---

### A&S: Choices over time are stationary

![](figures/CBTDemandFunctions.png){width=70%}

- Allocations between $t$ and $t+k$ do not depend on $t$ ⇒ they are **stationary**.  
- Estimated $\beta\approx1$, annual $\delta\approx.7$.

---

### What gives? 

::: {.no-bullets .incremental}
- The experiment of A&S seems like a resounding success of the exponential discounting model. It can fit the data extremely well. 
- Maybe A&S overcontrolled for potential confounds:
    - Participants did not receive any immediate payment, even today's earnings were delivered by mail to their postbox. 
    - Thus there may still be scope for present bias not between today vs. future but between *right now* vs. later.
:::

---

### How soon is now? 

::: {.no-bullets .incremental}
- Balakrishnan, Haushofer, Jakiela (ExpEcon, 2020) conduct a CTB experiment where they vary the "now" payout. 
- All participants receive money via mobile payment. 
- They either pay the "now" payout immediately or at the end of the day. 
:::

---

### BHJ (2020): Now is not this evening

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](figures/CBTHowSoonIsNow.png){width=70%}
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Today-payment **immediate** ⇒ $\beta\approx 0.91.$
- Today-payment **this evening** ⇒ $\beta\approx 1.$
- Suggests that present bias is about *right now* vs. *later*, not today vs. tomorrow.
:::
:::

---

### Meta-analysis of CTB studies

Imai, Rutter, Camerer (EJ, 2021) provide a **meta study** of CBT experiments. Each dot below is a $\beta$-estimate coming from a separate study. 

![](figures/CBTMeta.png){width=70%}

---

### IRC: Findings

::: {.incremental .no-bullets}
- In experiments following A&S (allocate money over time, get today's payment this evening), $\beta \approx 1.$ 
- In experiments where participants have to work during experimental sessions and can allocate how much to work at different points in time, $\beta \approx 0.88$ → people postpone work.
    - This coheres well with BHJ, as participants usually conduct today's work directly after making the allocation choice.
    - Therefore, the decision over work is also a decision about *right now* vs. *later*.

:::

---

### Back to the $\beta-\delta$ model

::: {.incremental .no-bullets}
- The $\beta-\delta$ model can describe intertemporal choice rather well, if the "now" period is sufficiently narrowly defined. 
- A question coming out of this model is whether agents are aware of their bias. 
:::

--- 

## {auto-animate="true"}
### Example: Smoking {.example}

::: {.incremental .no-bullets}
- Consider an agent who considers whether to smoke or not. The agent is present biased ($\beta < 1$). For simplicity, assume that $\delta = 1.$
- Smoking gives the agent an immediate consumption joy $j$ but carries some cost $c$ in a future time period. 
- Suppose that $c > j > \beta c.$ 
    - The agent prefers smoking right now over not smoking ($j>\beta c$).
    - But the agent prefers to quit smoking later ($c > j$).
:::

---

## {auto-animate="true"}
### Example: Smoking {.example}

::: {.no-bullets}
- Suppose that $c > j > \beta c.$ 
    - The agent prefers smoking right now over not smoking ($j>\beta c$).
    - But the agent prefers to quit smoking later ($c > j$).
- If the agent is aware of their bias, they might try to stop themselves from smoking later: go to rehab, do not buy tobacco, etc. 
- If the agent is unaware, they will naively expect to quit smoking. 
    - Because of this, they *underinvest* in mitigation.

### Sophistication in the $\beta-\delta$ model

::: {.incremental .no-bullets}
- The example illustrates how **sophistication** about present bias plays a key role for the welfare implications of the $\beta-\delta$ model. 
- If individuals are aware of their bias, they might get proactive to stop them from being short-sighted:
    - Avoid restaurants with "tempting" menu options. 
    - Install screen time blockers on their phone. 
    - ...

### Sophistication in the $\beta-\delta$ model

::: {.no-bullets}
- The example illustrates how **sophistication** about present bias plays a key role for the welfare implications of the $\beta-\delta$ model. 
- If they fully or partially neglect their bias, private initiative will not be enough. 
    - This then motivates various corrective taxes on alcohol, soda, cigarettes, etc. 
    - It calls for regulation of "addictive" social media algorithms.
    - Public programs to improve sleep hygiene. 
:::

---

### Empirical evidence on sophistication 

Alcott, Gentzkow, Song (AER 2022) document that individuals would like to limit their social media use, so they are generally aware of the problem.

### Empirical evidence on sophistication 

But individuals systematically underestimate their future use. This points to only partial sophistication.

### Takeaways

::: {.incremental .no-bullets}
- In dynamic decisions, humans disproportionately prefer the right now to the later. 
    - This causes **dynamic inconsistency.**
    - A model combining exponential discounting with a **present bias** factor ($\beta-\delta$ model) can describe empirical data well.
        - But only if the "now" period in the model means "right now", not "today" or "this week". 
- The $\beta-\delta$ model raises questions about sophistication. 
    - Humans are only partially sophisticated.
