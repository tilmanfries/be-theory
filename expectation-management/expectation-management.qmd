### Why study expectation management?

::: {.incremental .no-bullets}
- Standard **Expected-Utility Theory (EUT)** says information can often help make better decisions. 
- Since, in EUT, agents only care about the *outcomes* of their decision, information is never harmful.  
- Hence, the classical view that individuals aim to increase their understanding of the world. 
- **This lecture,** we will learn about why under a richer model of human motivation, the classical has serious shortcomings.

# Empirical puzzles EUT cannot explain

## {auto-animate="true"}
### Puzzle 1: Valuation depends on timing

Loewenstein (EJ, 1987) asks people for their valuation of (i) receiving an electrical shock, (ii) kissing their favorite movie star at different points in time. 

::: {.columns}

- They prefer kiss in 3 days to kiss today.
- But prefer shock today to shock next year.

- They prefer kiss in 3 days to kiss today.
- But prefer shock today to shock next year.
:::
::: 

The result is opposite from the time discounting prediction. Denote utility with shock as $u_s$ and utility without as $u_w$, with $u_w > u_s.$ Shock today and no shock in a year result in utility $u_s + \delta u_w.$ If $\delta < 1,$ this utility is smaller than $u_w + \delta u_s$ (shock in one year). Yet, people prefer former.

### Puzzle 2: Avoiding perfect information

::: {.no-bullets .incremental}
- Oster, Shoulson, Dorsey (AER, 2013) study whether people get tested for Huntington's disease.
  - This is a lethal disease, reducing life expectancy to around 40-50 years. 
  - It is also genetically transmitted. Therefore perfectly predictive DNA tests exist. 
  - Therefore: Hugely consequential if one has it, and accurate information is easily available
:::

### Puzzle 2: Avoiding perfect information

OSD document that: Only a small minority of at-risk patients gets tested (left panel), but once positive, they change behavior drastically (right panel).

## {auto-animate="true"}
### Standard EUT logic & the paradox  
::: {.no-bullets .incremental}
- Consider an agent who makes a decision like whether to become pregnant or to retire ($z\in \mathcal Z).$
- Any decision will be evaluated differently depending on whether they have Huntington's or not. Denote the utilities with and without Huntington's as $u_h(z)$ and $u_n(z).$
- If the belief to have Huntington's is $p$, the agent chooses $z$ that solves: $\max_{z\in\mathcal Z} \;p\,u_h(z)+(1-p)u_n(z)$
  - A well-behaved solution will solve the first-order condition: $p u_h'(z^e) + (1-p)u_n'(z^e) = 0.$
:::

---

## {auto-animate="true"}
### Standard EUT logic & the paradox  
::: {.no-bullets}
- If the belief to have Huntington's is $p$, the agent chooses $z$ that solves: $\max_{z\in\mathcal Z} \;p\,u_h(z)+(1-p)u_n(z)$
  - A well-behaved solution will solve the first-order condition: $p u_h'(z^e) + (1-p)u_n'(z^e) = 0.$
- Different from choice when knowing that one has Huntington's or not, solving: $u_h'(z^h) = 0$ or $u_n'(z^n) = 0$. 
  - Therefore, the decision taken under uncertainty will always be *suboptimal* once the agent learns about having the disease or not. $\rightarrow$ Agent prefers having the info when making the decision.
:::

---

### Resolving the paradox
::: {.incremental .no-bullets}
- The paradoxes can be resolved by adopting a psychological notion of utilty. 
- Agents may experience anticipatory anxiety or dread, they may wish to dream about the future, and receive value from anticipating good things to happen to them. This likely explains the results:
  - People don't want to be anxious for a year expecting the electrical shock to come. 
  - They enjoy thinking about how they are going to kiss soon. 
  - In the case of Huntington's disease, ignorance is bliss.

# Belief-based utility

---

## Belief-based utility: Model setup

We embed *beliefs* $\tilde\theta$ directly in utility.

::: definition
**Utility with ego pay-off**

$$
U(z,\theta,\tilde{\theta}) = u(z,\theta)\;+\;\mu\,\tilde{\theta},\qquad \mu>0.
$$

$u$: material (outcome) utility • $\tilde\theta$: *belief* “I’m talented”.
:::

**Eg:** Agent is an entrepreneur with talent $\theta.$ Their material outcome depends on their talent, but they may also wish to think that they are talented.

---

### Belief-based utility: Application
*Memory-manipulation game*

Consider an entrepreneur who can invest ($z=1$) in a project at cost $c\in(0,1).$ Depending on the entrepreneur's ability (*high* or *low*), the project return is:
$$
u(z,\theta) \begin{cases}
1 - c, & a = 1\text{ and }\theta = \theta_H, \\
- c, & a = 1\text{ and }\theta = \theta_L, \\
0, & a = 0.
\end{cases}
$$

The **total utility** is the sum of the investment utility and the entrepreneur's  belief that they are high ability: $u(z,\theta) + \mu P(\theta = \theta_H).$
---

### Belief-based utility: Application

:::{.incremental .no-bullets}
- To study attitudes towards information, suppose that the entrepreneur receives a signal $s$ about their talent *before* deciding whether to invest.
  - Signal $s$ can either be bad ($b$) or null (no info, $\varnothing$).
  - After observing $s=b,$ the entrepreneur then decides whether to memorize ($m = b$) or forget ($m = \varnothing$). 
  - When deciding whether to invest, the agent can only recall what's in their memory, but not the precise signal.
:::

---

### Timeline

![](figures/manipulation_timeline.png){width=80%}

- $t=1:$ Observe signal $s\in\{b,\varnothing\}.$ After receiving $b,$ decide to remember ($m=b$) or not ($m=\varnothing$).
- $t=2:$ Observe $m$ and make investment choice. 
- $t=3:$ If invested, observe investment outcome ($\Pi$). If successful, entrepreneur knows they are $\theta_H.$ If fails, entrepreneur knows they are $\theta_L.$
- $t=4:$ Utilities materialize.

---

### Model solution

:::{.no-bullets}
- We solve this model using Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium. 

:::{.definition}
**Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium (PBE)**

A strategy profile and belief system are a Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium if:

1. The agent's strategy maximizes their expected utility given their belief.

2. Beliefs are updated using Bayes’ rule wherever possible.
:::
:::

---

:::{.no-bullets .incremental}
- This is a **psychological** model because:
  1. The agent has *belief-based utility;* their utility depends on how talented they think they are. 
  2. The agent can *manipulate* their memory. In particular, they can decide to forget bad news. 
    - There is strong empirical evidence that individuals can choose what to remember (to some extent). We'll learn about one such example later.
- Everything else is rational. In particular, we need PBE to close the model and derive a solution. 
  - Definitely unrealistic, but PBE is an important benchmark.
:::

---

### Solving the model

:::{.no-bullets .incremental}
- We solve the model by backwards induction. 
- In $t=2,$ the agent holds some belief $\tilde{\theta}_2$ about their talent and chooses $a\in\{0,1\}.$ 
  - If $a=0,$ material utility is zero and the agent will not update their talent belief. Therefore, $E_2[U(a = 0, \theta,\tilde{\theta})] = \mu\tilde{\theta}_2(m).$
  - If $a=1,$ the material utility depends on talent. The expected utility is:
  \begin{align*}
  E_2[U(a=1, \theta,\tilde{\theta})] = \tilde{\theta}_2(m)(1-c + \mu\times 1) \\ + (1-\tilde{\theta}_2(m))(-c + \mu\times 0)
  \end{align*}
:::

---

### Solving the model

:::{.no-bullets .incremental}
- Consequently, invest if:
\begin{align*}
\small E_2[U(a=1, \theta,\tilde{\theta})] \geq E_2[U(a=0, \theta,\tilde{\theta})] 
\small \Rightarrow \tilde{\theta}_2(m) \geq c.
\end{align*}
- This is an intuitive solution: The agent invests if their talent belief is sufficiently high. 
- This finishes the analysis of the decision in $t=2.$ Now we move to $t=1$ and ask how the entrepreneur decides to remember, given their $t=2$ decision.
:::

---

### Solving the model

:::{.no-bullets .incremental}
- In $t=1,$ after receiving $s=b,$ entrepreneur decides whether to remember it or not. 
- Note that in $t=1$ the entrepreneur's talent belief is equal to:
\begin{align*}\small
\tilde{\theta}_1(s = b) = \frac{\tilde{\theta}_0 (1-q)}{\tilde{\theta}_0 (1-q) + (1 - \tilde{\theta}_0) q},\,
\tilde{\theta}_1(s = \varnothing) = \frac{\tilde{\theta}_0 q}{\tilde{\theta}_0 q + (1 - \tilde{\theta}_0) (1-q)}.
\end{align*}
- (Above, $q$ is signal precision.)
- We will investigate the existence of two types of equilibria: (i) **Full Realism** (always remember), (ii) **Delusion** (always forget).
:::

---

### Equilibrium Existence

:::{.proposition}
**Full Realism Equilibrium.** There is a $\hat{c} \in(0,1)$ such that a full realism equilibrium exists if and only if $c \leq \hat{c}.$
:::

:::{.proposition}
**Delusionary Equilibrium.** There are two thresholds $\hat{c}_L\in (0,1)$ and $\hat{c}_H \in(\hat{c}_L, 1)$ such that a delusionary equilibrium exists if (i) either $c \leq \hat{c}_L$ or (ii) $c \geq \hat{c}_H.$
:::

(Proof on board)

## {auto-animate="true"}
### Model Intuitions

:::{.no-bullets .incremental}
- The model describes a tradeoff between deluding oneself to boost ego-utility and holding realistic beliefs to make a better investment decision:
  - If $c$ is very high, the entrepreneur never invests. But then, *realism* cannot be an equilibrium as forgetting bad news always boosts the entrepreneur's without leading to investment.
  - Delusion is optimal if it has no material consequences. 
:::

---

## {auto-animate="true"}
### Model Intuitions

:::{.no-bullets}
- The model describes a tradeoff between deluding oneself to boost ego-utility and holding realistic beliefs to make a better investment decision:
  - If $c$ is in an intermediate range, the entrepreneur invests when remembering $m = \varnothing$ but not when remembering $m = b.$ Therefore, *delusion* cannot be an equilibrium in this intermediate range, as a deluded entrepreneur would invest and, thus, learn about their true talent. 
:::

---

## {auto-animate="true"}
### Model Intuitions

:::{.no-bullets}
- The model describes a tradeoff between deluding oneself to boost ego-utility and holding realistic beliefs to make a better investment decision:
  - The model also suggests that *delusion* is economically inefficient. A delusionary entrepreneur sometimes does not invest when they should. 
  - Intuitively, an investor remembering $m=\varnothing$ cannot be sure whether they deluded themselves or really did not observe bad news. Therefore, investors are overly skeptical after remembering nothing and cautious to invest.

# Evidence for belief-manipulation

---

## {auto-animate="true"}
### Selective recall (Zimmermann, AER, 2020)

:::{.no-bullets .incremental}
- Zimmermann conducts an IQ test with participants to obtain a proxy for "talent."
- Participants are then matched into groups of ten and ranked according to performance. 
- **Prior belief elicitation:** Directly after matching, they are asked: What is $P(\text{top half rank})?$
- **Signal provision:** Are compared to 3 random group members and told about the relative rank. E.g:
  - *"You rank higher than 2 and lower than 1."* (good)
  - *"You rank higher than 1 and lower than 2."* (bad)

- **Variation in timing:** Posterior belief elicitation either immediately or after 1 month, to identify *memory.*
:::

---

### Results 

![](figures/MotivatedMemory.png){width=92%}

* Bad-news signals largely **forgotten** one month later.  
* Good-news signals are largely **remembered.**
  - This points to asymmetric memory.

---

### Wishful thinking 
*Engelmann, Lebreton, Salem-Garcia, Schwardmann, van der Weele (AER, 2024)*

:::{.incremental .no-bullets}
- They ask: If people receive news they find scary, are they more likely to ignore it? 
- In particular, participants in the experiment may receive an electrical shock. They receive information about whether they will receive it or not. Do people ignore information that they will receive a shock?
:::

--- 

### Gabor task

ELSSW use a **Gabor task** to measure belief updating.

A figure appears for 150ms on the screen. Participants guess whether it tilts left or right.

:::{.fragment}
![](figures/gabor.png){width=40%}
:::

---

### Treatment manipulation

::: {.no-bullets .incremental}
- The treatments vary:
  - Whether participants can receive an electrical shock after a left-tilt or a right-tilt. 
  - How tilted the shapes are. Intuitively, the task is easy is tilt is strong and difficult if tilt is weak.
- This allows them to identify:
  1. Whether participants are **less accurate** at identifying tilts that may entail an electrical shock. If they do, they engage in *wishful thinking.*
  2. Whether wishful thinking depends on the task complexity. 
:::

---

### Results

![](figures/AnticipatoryAnxiety.png){width=40%}

* Participants are less accurate when identifying [shock patterns]{style="color: var(--my-red);"} than when identifying neutral patterns. 
* Especially if the tilt is low (i.e., the task is difficult).

---

### Takeaways

::: {.no-bullets .incremental}
- Belief-based motives such as striving for *self-esteem* or the avoidance of *dread* influence belief formation. 
- But human beliefs are not infinitely flexible:
  - In Zimmermann (2020), participants forget bad news after one month, but they incorporate these news when asked immediately. 
  - In ELSSW (2024), wishful thinking is higher when information is ambiguous than when it is precise. 
- This suggests that *self-serving beliefs* are more likely to occur in ambiguous information environments. 
  - But many economic environments are ambiguous.
:::

---

### Extensions I

::: {.no-bullets .incremental}
- Belief based utility and information management have many economic applications:
  - Bénabou (ReStud, 2013): Groups are prone to motivated beliefs because such beliefs are often complements. 
  - E.g., if others ignore climate change, there may be no point of being realistic about it as: (i) Realism brings dread, (ii) fighting climate change requires a *critical mass* not ignoring it. 
  - "Realist" and "Delusionary" equilibria often coexist, so sudden shifts from Delusion to Realism are possible.
:::

---

### Extensions II

::: {.no-bullets .incremental}
- Motivated beliefs as a means of *self control:*
  - Bénabou & Tirole (QJE, 2003): Present-biased individuals may delude themselves into thinking that hard work pays off because such a belief helps them stop procrastinate.
  - Bönisch et al. (WP, 2024) provide consistent evidence: Shortly before the micro exam, students believe that learning is more useful than long before or right after the exam. 
:::

---

## {auto-animate="true"}
### Extensions II

::: {.no-bullets .incremental}
- Bénabou and Tirole (QJE, 2006) use the self-control channel to explain US-Europe difference in the tax and transfer system:
  - Americans delude themselves into thinking that hard work pays off → They think they can reach anything by working hard → Hence, they vote for lower taxes and transfers → This makes the delusion that working hard pays off even more attractive...
  - "Lock-in" effect, where the American Dream and a slim state reinforce each other.

### Extensions II

::: {.no-bullets}
- Bénabou and Tirole (QJE, 2006) use the self-control channel to explain US-Europe difference in the tax and transfer system:
  - Europeans delude themselves by thinking that effort does not matter for success → They expect that social structures predetermine everything → Hence, they vote for redistribution from *"undeserving rich"* to others → This makes it even more attractive to think that working hard does not pay off...
  - "Lock-in" effect, where belief in a rigged system and a large state reinforce each other.

## {auto-animate="true"}
### The Big Picture

::: {.no-bullets .incremental}
- **The classical view:** Individuals acquire information to inform themselves, they wish to have accurate beliefs about the world to improve their decisions. 
  - The fundamentals of the economy determine beliefs. 
- **The modern view:** Individuals trade off accuracy with desires such as *self-esteem, ego utility, dread, self-control.* 
  - People may vote on changes to the tax-and-transfer system to support their delusions, they may seek out teams with diffused responsibilities that support "delusionary" optimistic beliefs.

  - People may vote on changes to the tax-and-transfer system to support their delusions, they may seek out teams with diffused responsibilities that support "delusionary" optimistic beliefs. 
  - **Beliefs as a collective action problem:** Incentives for realism vs. delusions depend on the structure of society: Hence, beliefs can be *socially determined* and changing them may require social coordination.
:::

---

### Final Takeaways

::: {.incremental}
- Standard theory assumes people seek accurate beliefs, but real-world behavior often deviates from this.
- Behavioral models explain why people avoid information or distort their beliefs: psychological motives like self-esteem, hope, or dread matter.
- Empirical evidence shows selective memory and wishful thinking are common, especially when information is ambiguous or emotionally charged.
- This opens up space to a whole different economics.
