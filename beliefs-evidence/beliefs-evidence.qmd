### From *Normative* to *Positive*  

::: {.incremental .no-bullets}
- Last time we learned how beliefs *should* update.  
- Now, we will learn how human beliefs **actually** update.
  - Lab evidence: *bookbags-and-pokerchips* paradigm  
  - Field evidence: betting & forecasting data  
  - A unifying model: **over- vs. under-reaction** to information

# Direct Tests – Bookbags and Pokerchips

### Experimental setup

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="65%"}
- Two bags, each with 100 chips  
  - **Bag A:** $q$% [red]{style="color:var(--my-red)"}, $1-q$% [blue]{style="color:var(--my-blue)"}  
  - **Bag B:** $1-q$% [red]{style="color:var(--my-red)"}, $q$% [blue]{style="color:var(--my-blue)"}  
  - $q>0.5$ → red is *diagnostic* of A  
- Bag A is chosen with probability $\lambda.$
- $n$ draws revealed to participant.  
- Task: report $p\equiv P(\text{Bag}=A\,|\,n\text{ draws}).$

:::{.no-bullets}
- The figure plots participant estimates (y-axis) vs. Bayesian estimates (x-axis). 
- Participant estimates are compressed towards their prior.
  - This is commonly known as **conservatism bias:** People revise their beliefs in the correct direction but **not far enough.**
:::

---

### Limits and Advantages

:::{.no-bullets}
- The **bookbags and pokerchips** paradigm allows for a precise comparison of beliefs to a Bayesian benchmark. 
- But the beliefs that we are more interested in do not allow for the same, precise comparison:
  - Eg., it may be relevant to ask whether *financial markets* over- or underreact to information, or whether people learn rationally from *reading the news.* Finding the normative benchmark (how much people *should* react) is often impossible in these cases.
- But some did still try (next).

### Challenges when moving outside the lab

::: {.incremental .no-bullets}
- In the lab, we have full control over the signal-generating process. This allows us to compare subjective estimates of $p$ to the Bayesian estimate. 
- In the field, we often do not know the Bayesian estimate, so it is difficult to say how wrong beliefs are. 
- But we can test other properties of probability measures. A nice candidate is:

### Potential Empirical Setup 

::: {.incremental .no-bullets}
- Suppose we can identify an empirical setting with a binary state that can be *true* or *false,* $\small\Omega = \{T,F\}.$ Many potential scenarios:
  - Whether the EU lifts sanctions on Russia by 2026. 
  - Whether inflation will be higher than GDP growth this year. 
  - Whether LMU admin will go digital by 2035...

### Potential Empirical Setup 

::: {.no-bullets}
- Suppose we can identify an empirical setting with a binary state that can be *true* or *false,* $\small\Omega = \{T,F\}.$
- In such a setting, we could repeatedly ask participants for $P_t(\omega = T)$ at different $t,$ denoted as $p_t.$ 
  - Or we could simply use betting market data. 
- The nice thing when the state is binary is that eliciting $p_t$ pins down the whole belief distribution:
$$
\mu_t(\omega = T) = p_t,\,\mu_t(\omega = F) = 1 - p_t,\, \text{Var}_{\mu_t} = p_t(1-p_t).
$$

### Potential Empirical Setup 

::: {.no-bullets}
- We can additionally define *belief movement* and *uncertainty reduction* between $t=1$ and $t=2$.
:::

:::{.definition}
**Definition.** 
*Belief movement* $M$ denotes by how much beliefs change between the evaluation periods **1** and **2**:
$$
M = (p_2 - p_1)^2.
$$

:::

:::{.definition}
**Definition.** 
*Uncertainty reduction* $R$ denotes the reduction in belief variance between periods **1** and **2**:
$$
R = p_1(1-p_1) - p_2(1-p_2). 
$$

### The insight of Augenblick and Rabin (QJE, 2021)

A&R observe the following result:

:::{.proposition}
**Proposition.**
If $\mu_t$ is a probability measure, then $\mathbb{E}[M] = \mathbb{E}[R].$
:::

This is a direct consequence of the martingale property. 

(Proof on board)

### Testing with real forecasts  

::: {.incremental .no-bullets}
- A&R test their predictions:
  - Using a panel of experts making probabilistic forecasts. 
    - E.g., *"Will Greece remain a member of the EU through June 2012?"*
  - Using a baseball prediction algorithm. 
  - Using sports betting market data.

- Algorithm & betting markets (cols 2 + 3) are much closer to Bayesian benchmark.
- But betting market movement still overshoots by $\approx 4.6\%.$
:::

---

### A puzzle? 

::: {.no-bullets}
- Lab experiments on bookbags and pokerchips suggest that individual beliefs move too little in response to new information. 
- A&R conceive a comparable test to test for belief movements outside the lab. They find that individual forecasters move their predictions by too much. 
- We will learn about a unifying explanation next.

# Over- vs. underinference

---

## {auto-animate="true"}
:::{.incremental .no-bullets}
- Augenblick, Lazarus, Thaler (QJE, 2025) study why individuals sometimes over- and sometimes underinfer from data. 

- **Idea:** Distinguishing **good news** from **bad news** is often easy. It is much harder to say *how much better* one piece of good news is to another piece.
  - E.g., beating earnings expectations is good news for a firm's valuation. But difficult to assess by *how much* its value should increase.
- In other words, a signal's **qualitative valence** ($+$ or $-$) is easier to assess than the **quantitative size** of the signal.  
:::

- In other words, a signal's **qualitative valence** ($+$ or $-$) is easier to assess than the **quantitative size** of the signal.  
- $\rightarrow$ Developing this idea in a model we get overinference from weak signals and underinference from strong signals. (Next)
:::

---

### Setup

::: {.no-bullets .incremental}
- Binary state of the world, $\omega \in\{H,L\};$ an agent has prior $P(\omega = H) = \lambda.$
- The agent receives a signal $s\in\{g,b\}$ with signal strength $P(s = g | \omega = H) = P(s=b|\omega=L) = q.$ 
- However, the agent does not know $q$ for sure. They have some idea that the average good signal has a $q$ distributed according to $\mathcal{N}(\bar{q}_0, \sigma_0).$ 
- Upon observing $s$, the agent receives an additional signal *about the size of $q$*, $q_s|q \sim \mathcal{N}(q, \sigma_q).$
:::

---

### Setup

::: {.no-bullets .incremental}
- This setup combines a binary-binary updating model with a normal-normal model. 
  - The agent receives a binary signal about a binary state. 
  - They receive a normal signal about the normally distributed signal strength.
- Updating follows a two-step procedure:
  1. Observe signal valence and estimate signal strength.
  2. Use the estimated signal strength to update beliefs about the state of the world.
:::

---

### Over- vs. underinference 

:::{.proposition}
**Proposition.** 
The agent's estimated signal strength is equal to 
$$
\bar{q}_1 = \alpha q_s + (1-\alpha)\bar{q}_0,\text{ where }\alpha = \frac{\sigma_0}{\sigma_0 + \sigma_q}
$$
:::

This directly follows from the normal-normal model.

**Implication:** Individuals overestimate weak signals and they underestimate strong signals.

![](figures/OverUnder.png){width=60% .center}

:::{.no-bullets}
**Key prediction:** Individuals overinfer from weak signals and underinfer from strong signals.
:::

---

### Bookbags & pokerchips revisited  

ALT conduct a lab belief updating experiment and find overinference if $q < 0.6$ and underinference if $q>0.6.$

![](figures/ALTLab.png){width=66% alt="Over-/under-inference in urn experiments"}

    - The y-axis is normalized. y>1 means overinference and y<1 means underinference.

- The metastudy by Benjamin (2019) we saw earlier could not find this as all experiments it considered had $q\geq 0.6$!

---

### Betting-market evidence  

:::{.no-bullets}
- ALT also aim for a test of reactions towards weak and strong signals in sports betting and financial markets.

- They propose that, in sports, news that are revealed early in the game are less informative about the game outcome than equivalent news revealed later. 
  - E.g., in football, scoring the first goal in min. 1 is less informative than scoring the first goal in min. 89. 

- Based on this, they predict that **belief movement > uncertainty reduction** early in the game and **belief movement < uncertainty reduction** late in the game. 
:::

---

### Betting-market evidence  

![](figures/OverUnderSports.png){width=75% alt="Excess movement early vs. late in sports matches"}

- Markets move **too much** early, **too little** late.  
- Similar for long- vs. short-maturity stock options.

# Takeaways  

::: {.incremental .no-bullets}
1. **Lab tests** (bookbags & pokerchips) → *conservatism* on average.  
2. **Field tests** (forecast panels, betting) → *excess belief movement*.  
3. Aggregation in markets partly corrects individual biases.  
4. A unified view: People find it easier to judge the valence than the size of a signal.
   ⇒ they **over-react to weak** and **under-react to strong** information.
