### Exam 

::: {.no-bullets .incremental}

- You will write an exam.
    - Probably at the date of the last lecture (July 22).
    - But I will let you know after confirmation from ISC. 

- You can bring a calculator and one page with handwritten notes (DIN A4, written on both sides).

- Expect similar questions in the exam as in the exercises.
    - So prepare the exercises *before* we discuss them in class. 
    - AI can help you with exercises but not with exam.
