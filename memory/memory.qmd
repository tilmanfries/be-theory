## Why talk about **stereotypes**?

::: {.incremental .no-bullets}
- *Less* information sometimes *improves* decisions  
  – E.g., the introduction of blind orchestral auditions increased female hires (Goldin & Rouse 2000).  
- This implies **pre-existing stereotypes** can distort decisions.
- How do such stereotypes form and persist?  
  <br/>This lecture: robust empirical patterns and a new memory-based model.

### The representativeness heuristic

::: {.example}
Linda is 31, single, outspoken, very bright.  Philosophy major, active in social-justice & anti-nuclear demos.  
Which is **more probable**?  
1. Linda is a bank-teller  
2. Linda is a bank-teller **and** a feminist  
:::
Tversky and Kahneman (PR, 1982) report that 85 % pick (2). This violates **sum rule**:  

- The event "bank-teller + feminist" is a subset of the event "bank-teller". By the sum rule, $P(\text{bank-teller + feminist})\le P(\text{bank-teller}).$  

---

::: {.incremental .no-bullets}
- The Linda example is interesting because it intuitively cues associations in our brain. 
    - *"Linda cares about social justice and is against nuclear power, so she **must be** a feminist."*
- The same kind of thinking seems to occur in other contexts.
    - For example, people may reason: *"He supports right-wing populism so he **must be** a misogynist, bigot, and have a worryingly high consumption of energy drinks."*
- How do these associations occur? To understand this, we need to learn a bit about human memory...

### Imperfect memory 

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
:::{.no-bullets}
- Suppose we aim to have a psychologically realistic model of how people remember. The first thing that we might want to assume is that people forget things. 
- This is the **sieve model** of memory. Individuals learn and store information, but over time, some details slip through and are lost.

### Memory as a sieve? 

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
:::{.no-bullets}
- The sieve model explains *some* memory features but misses out big parts. We do not only forget randomly, but also **suppress, reconstruct, and modify.**
- This research started with Bartlett (1930), who documents systematic distortions over time.

- A better analogy may be **memory as [Google search:]{style="color:var(--my-blue)"}**
    1. Google is imperfect, you do not always find what you search for. 
    2. But what you find can change day-by-day, just as you might sometimes remember what you thought you had forgotten. 
    3. Google makes does not always provide you with exactly what you are looking for.
        - E.g., googling *"weather in munich"* might return ad results on summer clothes. 
        - Just as when thinking about *summer,* I make associations to *ice cream*.

### Associative memory and stereotypes? 

::: {.incremental .no-bullets}
- **Question:** What is the % of red hair among the Irish? 
- The basic argument for why associative memory makes us overestimate this %:
    1. When I think about (red hair, Irish), a lot of reasons come to mind providing good evidence that many Irish persons are red haired. 
    2. When I think about (other hair, Irish), it is easy for my memory to make associations with *other-haired* people that are *not* Irish.

### Associative memory and stereotypes? 

::: {.no-bullets}
1. When I think about (red hair, Irish), a lot of reasons come to mind providing good evidence that many Irish persons are red haired. 
2. When I think about (other hair, Irish), it is easy for my memory to make associations with *other-haired* people that are *not* Irish.
    - Many non-Irish other-haired people exist. 
    - Not as many non-Irish red-haired people exist. 
    - Therefore, *memory interference* is larger when I think about (other hair, Irish) than about (red hair, Irish) $\rightarrow$ This makes me overestimate the %.
:::

---

### A minimal formal set-up  

::: {.no-bullets}
- This discussion follows Bordalo, Conlon, Gennaioli, Kwon, Shleifer (QJE, 2022).
- Consider an agent with a **memory database** $E$ which contains entries with *attribute vector* $a=(a_1,a_2).$ 
    - For example: $a_1 =$ hair color (red/other), $a_2 =$ nationality (Irish/non-Irish). 
- The agent's **task** is to estimate a conditional share $P(a_1|a_2).$
    - For example $P(a_1 = \text{red hair}| a_2 = \text{Irish}).$
:::

---

### The memory database 

::: {.no-bullets}
- Think of the memory database as capturing the joint distribution of $(a_1,a_2).$ For example, if the database is broadly accurate, then:  
:::

| | **Red Hair** | **Other hair** |
|-| ------------ | -------------- |
| **Irish** | 0.1% | 0.9% |
| **Non-Irish** | 1.5% | 97.5% |

- Searching for $(\text{Red Hair, Irish})$ returns $E(\text{Red Hair, Irish}) = 0.1\%.$
- An unbiased of $P(\text{Red Hair | Irish})$ is $\frac{0.1}{0.1 + 0.9} = 10\%.$ 

---

### Assumptions on Memory 

:::{.definition}
**Assumption** (Sampling and counting). To form belief $P(a_1 = x|a_2 = y)$, an agent sends two requests to their memory database, $q_1,$ asking for $T$ samples as evidence of $(a_1 = x\text{ and }a_2 = y)$ and $q_2,$ asking for $T>0$ samples as evidence of $(a_1 \neq x\text{ and }a_2 = y).$ The agent then keeps all the results that cohere with each request. Denote the observed coherent results by $R_{q_1}$ and $R_{q_2}$, respectively. In a second step, the agent combines these requests to obtain the estimate:
$$
\hat{P}(a_1 = x|a_2 = y) = \frac{R_{q_1}}{R_{q_1} + R_{q_2}}.
$$
:::
---

### Sampling & Counting Example

::: {.no-bullets}
- Recall the memory database, which captures the joint distribution:

| | **Red Hair** | **Other hair** |
|-| ------------ | -------------- |
| **Irish** | 0.1% | 0.9% |
| **Non-Irish** | 1.5% | 97.5% |

- Suppose the agent samples with $T = 10,000.$
- The agent first draws 10,000 samples from their database and keeps all results with (Red Hair, Irish) ... 
- The agent then draws 10,000 samples from their database and keeps all results with (Other Hair, Irish) ... 
- If this sampling is unbiased, then $R_{q_1} \approx 0.1\%\cdot T = 10$ and $R_{q_2} \approx 0.9\% \cdot T = 90$. 
- The estimate based on unbiased sampling is approx. equal to the truth:
$P(\text{red hair, Irish}) \approx \frac{10}{10 + 90} = 10\%$
:::

---

::: {.no-bullets .incremental}
- If this sampling is unbiased, then $\small R_{q_1} \approx 0.1\%\cdot T = 10$ and $\small R_{q_2} \approx 0.9\% \cdot T = 90.$
- The estimate based on unbiased sampling is approx. equal to the truth:
$\small P(\text{red hair, Irish}) \approx \frac{10}{10 + 90} = 10\%.$
- This sampling approach to belief formation is very common in cognitive psychology. 
    - It approximates the recall process. People sort through examples in their memory. 
    - You can also think of this as **simulation.** Rather than sorting through past memories of meeting Irish people, people may simulate examples of how Irish people look like. 
:::

---

### Step 2 – *Cued* recall  

::: definition
**Similarity weight** $S(a,q)\in[0,1]$  
highest when $a=q$, lowest when nothing matches.

**Cued recall probability**  

\[
r_q(a)=\frac{S(a,q)\;E(a)}{\sum_{a'\in\mathcal A}S(a',q)\,E(a')}.
\]
:::

Search term “red-haired + Irish” mostly returns red-haired Irish,  
but also (fewer) red-haired non-Irish, etc.

---

### Expected reported belief  

Combining sampling + cued recall (with $T$ large):

\[
\mathbb E[\hat P(x\mid y)]
=\frac{r_{q_1}}{\,r_{q_1}+r_{q_2}\,}
=\frac{E(x,y)}{E(x,y)+\alpha\;E(\neg x,y)},
\]

\[
\alpha
=\frac{\displaystyle\sum_{a} \tfrac{S(a,q_1)}{S(q_1,q_1)}E(a)}
         {\displaystyle\sum_{a} \tfrac{S(a,q_2)}{S(q_2,q_2)}E(a)}.
\]

- If unrelated items are **more similar** to $q_2$ than $q_1$ → $\alpha>1$ → **under-inference**.  
- If they are less similar → $\alpha<1$ → **over-inference**.

---

## Irish hair-colour example  

|                | Red hair | Other hair |
|----------------|----------|------------|
| Irish          | 10 %     | 90 %       |
| Non-Irish      | 1.5 %    | 98.5 %     |

Query $(\text{red},\text{Irish})$: few unrelated memories ⇒ $\alpha<1$ ⇒ **over-estimate** share of red-haired Irish.

Query $(\text{other},\text{Irish})$: many unrelated memories ⇒ $\alpha>1$ ⇒ **under-estimate**.

### Design – Bordalo et al. (2022)

![](figures/MemoryExperiment.png){width=70% .center}

40 slides → filler task → ask  
$P(\text{word}\mid\text{orange})\;?$

- *Neutral*: true share = 50 %.  
- Increasing **blue words** raises *interference*.  
- Increasing **orange words** raises true share.

---

### Results  

![](figures/MemoryExperimentResults.png){width=68% .center}

::: {.no-bullets}
- More blue-word clutter ↓ estimated orange-word share.  
- Raising true share raises estimate **less than 1-for-1**.  
✔️ Matches model predictions.

# Putting it together

## Take-aways  

::: {.incremental .no-bullets}
1. People **over-react** to weak cues, **under-react** to strong cues  
   – reconciles “conservatism” (lab) with “excess movement” (field).  
2. A **cued-recall** model formalises associative memory: similar but irrelevant evidence distorts sampling.  
3. Lifetime experiences & media cues shape beliefs for decades.  
4. **Contact quality matters** – cooperative exposure can loosen stereotypes, adversarial can harden them.  
5. Policy: design information & encounters to **steer the cue set** (blind auditions, balanced crime reporting, cooperative programmes).
